			      <div class="description">
			      	Greg's creative practice focuses on innovations of digital tools for mediations between individuals, communities and environments. His main focus is Data Culture. His art projects explore data culture critically and include polartide (Venice Biennale, 2013-2014) and The Black Cloud (Machine Project, Los Angeles, 2008). Black Cloud was funded by the MacArthur Foundation to provide an alternate reality game and a social network for measuring and taking actions to benefit air quality. The project has evolved into a startup company, Aclima Inc., where Greg serves as the Senior Advisor for Social Engagement. Greg has also innovated in the area of online education with a course on Data Culture, which is offered by UC ONLINE and UC Berkeley. The course features several educational media innovations, including the “Engagement Index” which is now under development as a LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) module for broader distribution.

			      <div class="description">
			      	Frank Steijns is violinist, composer, and the carillonneur of Maastricht, Weert and Heerlen (The Netherlands). He is known for his innovative concerts featuring carillon together with other instruments like piano, organ, choir, orchestra, ballet and even heavy metal bands. He plays a wide range of music, from pop and jazz to classical and avant-garde.
          			<br>
          			His goal is to bring the carillon to the people, instead of the other way around. He designed his own mobile carillon of 43 bells that can be assembled indoors or outdoors, in any room, concert hall, or space. It is the first carillon in the world to use dynamic electronic clappers, thus allowing it to be played both manually as electronically in the same way as a traditional carillon. This instrument was part of a large exhibition by Turkish artist Sarkis at the Submarine Wharf for the Boijmans van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam. In 2013, he took the carillon on a world tour to more than 100 major cities on all continents, playing for 1.5 million audience members with the orchestra of Andre Rieu.
